# VSCode Robust YAML

Extended YAML support for [Robust Toolbox](https://github.com/space-wizards/RobustToolbox) game engine (used for [Space Station 14](https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14))

## Features

> This extension is in early stages of development!

* Only entity prototypes and components are supported
  * Go to component/datafield/resource definition
  * Show component/datafield summary when hovering over it
  * Highlighting of components and resource paths
  * Component/datafield autocompletion

## Requirements

> This extension **does NOT provide base YAML support**, search other extensions (for example [YAML Language Support by Red Hat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-yaml)).

> C# extension is not required.
